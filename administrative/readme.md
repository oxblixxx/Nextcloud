# MANAGING USERS AND GROUPS IN NEXTCLOUD
## Accessing User Management:
- While users can be managed both through the console and the terminal, this documentation will focus on the console approach.
- From the Nextcloud console, click on your avatar icon in the top right corner, then select Users.

## Creating Users:
- To create a new user, click on Create Account.
- Fill in the required user details, including the username, password, email, and other relevant information.
- Assign the user to a specific group, and optionally designate the group the user should administer.
- You can also set a storage quota for the user.
- Finally, click Create to finalize the creation of the user.

## Creating Groups:
- To create a new group, click on the Plus icon next to groups.
- Enter the group name, and you may be prompted to set a password for the group.

## Account Settings:
- The Account Settings section allows you to modify user preferences, set defaults, and sort users as needed.
- Note that users cannot change their password upon [first login](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/force-password-change-at-user-logon/1664/14). Therefore, it's advisable to create a strong password for each user and enforce a 2FA.

## Managing Users:
- By clicking on the three dots next to a user, administrators can access additional options such as deleting or disabling the user account.
